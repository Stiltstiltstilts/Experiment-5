The practice trials are now over. Does everything make sense? If you have any questions ask the experimenter now.
Now the main experiment will start, the trials will have the same format as the practise trials and will take ~30mins. Once again we thank you for your attention during the experiment, and we remind you again to try and keep still and relaxed during the trials (when the sound is playing) and to not move your tongue or mouth the words silently as this can interfere with the EEG recording.
