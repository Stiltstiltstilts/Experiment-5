The practice trials are now over.
The first part of the main experiment will now involve measuring how well you can tap to a beat without the language component.
In the following trials, you will hear the beat and are to start tapping on the strong beats (once every three beats) until the sound stops.
Try and concentrate on the beat and tap as accurately as you can.
