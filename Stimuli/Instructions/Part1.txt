Welcome to the experiment. Thank you for participating we really appreciate it! The experiment will last for ~30mins, and then at the end, there will be a questionnaire (5mins).
This experiment involves listening to rhythmically presented speech and answering questions that test your understanding of the speech. More specifically, this experiment explores how aligning speech with musical meter effects comprehension. What is musical meter? Musical meter is a steady beat that is accented to make different patterns of STRONG and WEAK beats. Stereotypically, a march is in a binary meter (STRONG weak STRONG weak etc) and a waltz is in a ternary meter (STRONG weak weak STRONG weak weak etc).        Press 'b' twice to hear a binary beat, and press 't' twice to hear a ternary beat.
The experiment is composed of a series of short trials. Each trial will have the same format as shown in the image below. Your task, in order of importance, is to 1. imagine the speech in the perscribed meter as clearly as you can, and 2. try and comprehend the speech so you can answer the probe question as accurately as you can.
When the probe question appears on the screen, you are to respond 'y' if the probe is correct, 'n' if the probe is incorrect, or 'd' if you don't know and would otherwise just randomly guess. You are to respond as quickly as you can, while trying to be correct ~70% of the time. If you take longer than 5 seconds, you will be reminded to speed up on the next trial. During the trials, keep your fingers resting on the 'y' and 'n' keys ready to press the button. You will get practise on these trials before the real trials start so don't worry if things aren't 100% clear yet.
You control when each trial starts, so feel free to take short breaks to keep your concentration high. And you are always welcome to ask the experimenter questions during these breaks if anything is unclear. Good science is made possible by good participants, so thank you in advance for your cooperation. We really appreciate it!
Press the spacebar to start some practice trials (that don't count for the main experiment). Use these to make sure everything makes sense.
